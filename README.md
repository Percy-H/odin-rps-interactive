# SO, what is this>

I tried to write this project before, failed, felt that failure, and set it aside.

Then, while on vacation and with flaky internet access, I decided to just approach it my way. In the end, I didn't really follow the instructions, but made something I'm happy with. There's no function called "game". User input is handled by clicking on one's choice, not text prompts. And I decided 5 rounds didn't make sense, because it could result in a tie, so I wrote it to be first to three.
